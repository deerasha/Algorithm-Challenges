 * "The next problem Harry solved quite quickly as well - the Bookshelf [BLUE]
 * problem. The solution used dynamic programming." So the UCT guys who won in
 * both the years that they could take part(cos they reached the finals
 * TWICE)used DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING to solve the problem. But wait- we at UKZN
 * don't need to worry about dynamic programming because its never used in these
 * contests! Note that they used dynamic programming for at least one problem
 * per contest. Must get resources on the subject...
