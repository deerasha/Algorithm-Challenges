Please note that when submitting java programs 
the main method must exist in a class called Main.
So always rename class Main before submitting or there will be a 
Compiler Error
Classes should not be public
import classes individually because some classes(such as IO) are
restricted.
java.lang.math is ok
and so is java.util (.* ? It is quite powerful!)
